# command-handler
Command handler prototyping.

## What is this?
This repository contains the barebones of a "command handler" for chat platforms.

Currently, it isn't finished and you shouldn't use it yet. 

## Implementations
This command handler is planned to be integrated as:

- A plugin in [ferriswheel](https://github.com/FerrisChat/ferriswheel)
- A plugin in [wumpus.py](https://github.com/jay3332/wumpus.py/)

More to come the future.
